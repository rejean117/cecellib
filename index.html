                   We built this website because we truly love Cecelib’s stories the every twist, every character, every unforgettable moment. As fans, we often found ourselves wanting a simple and organized way to keep track of all the amazing stories: the ones we’re currently following, the ones we’ve already completed, and the ones we’re excited to read next.
                    <br><br>
                   That’s why we created this space,  not as a forum or discussion hub, but as a clean, easy-to-use guide for fellow fans. Here, you’ll find updates on ongoing stories, lists of completed ones, and helpful directions on where to read them. It’s our way of staying connected to the stories we love and helping other fans do the same.
                    <br><br>
                    This site was made by fans, for fans with love, appreciation, and a lot of reading hours. We hope it helps make your Cecelib experience even more enjoyable!                    <a href="home.html">
